function [sol, historic] = pso_algo(RaPIdObject)
%PSO_ALGO Applies the particle swar optimisation function OWN_PSO and
%applies it to the parameter identification problem specified.
%   Takes as argument the settings struct in which the data to be matched
%   by the parameter estimation was integrated by the function rapid.m It
%   starts by generating nb_particle particles (value set in
%   settings.pso_options). The initial particles are partly randomlu chosen
%   and partly spans the parameter space, being regularly spaced out within
%   the bounds specified by p_min and p_max the objective function is
%   evaluated at every iterations, after each has been given a speed which
%   is determined by random parameters and influenced by the position of
%   the overall best solution found and the particle personal best position
%   The function returns the historic of all the best position and best
%   fitness at every iteration of the process and the swarm at final time
%   if required.
%
%   settings should include a struct field name pso_options containing:
%       - kick_multiplier: when the speed becomes lower than
%           norm(v_max)*kick_multiplier, v_max being the speed (computed
%           internally) which would lead the particle as far as possible
%           inside the space defined by p_min/p_max
%       - w: multiplier on the contribution of the last sample of the
%            particle's speed to it's next sample
%       - self_coeff: multiplier on the contribution of the distance to the
%           particle's personal best position to the next sample of
%           the speed
%       - social_coeff: multiplier on the contribution of the distance to the swarm's
%           overall best position to the next sample of the speed
%       - limit: number maximal of iterations in the speeds updates
%       - fitnessStopRatio: the algorithm stops if the best fitness reaches
%           initialFitness*fitnessStopRatio
%       - nb_particles: number of particles in the swarm
%       - nRandMin, minimum of initial particles to be generated
%       randomly, restricts the number of particles to be set on a grid
%       regularly spaced out in the parameter space, see function
%       generateOrganisedSwarm
%       - p0s, matrix whose rows are different initial guesses for the
%       vector of parameters
%       - storeData, boolean allowing to store all the best fitness and
%       particles at every iterations (get's big very quickly)
